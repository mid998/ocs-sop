Expand the ceph cluster by scaling present machineset. 

.Check on our current machinesets:
----
oc get machines -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'
----

.Scale the current machineset:
----
# Scale the replicas to 1 more than the Desired column above. i.e. If the current "Desired" is 1, make the replicas=2
oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api -o name | grep workerocs | xargs -n1 -t oc scale -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=2
----

.Watch and verify the new machines are ready:
----
watch "oc get machinesets -n openshift-machine-api | egrep 'NAME|workerocs'"
----

.WIP Add capacity via the OCP web console:
----
Can this be done (easily) via the cli? 
If not, include 7.2 Add storage capacity from training or OCS docs. 
----

.Enter the tools pod that you created in <<Using the Rook-Ceph toolbox to check on the Ceph backing storage,the previous section>>:
