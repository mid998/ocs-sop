The cause of the missing replicas must be determined and fixed. Basic troubleshooting starting with operator status all the way to OCP health may be required.

*OCS Operator Subscription Health:*

.Check the ocs-operator subscription status
----
oc get sub ocs-operator -n openshift-storage  -o json | jq .status.conditions
----

Like all operators, the status conditions types are:

*CatalogSourcesUnhealthy, InstallPlanMissing, InstallPlanPending, InstallPlanFailed*

The status for each type should be False. For example:

```
[
  {
    "lastTransitionTime": "2021-01-26T19:21:37Z",
    "message": "all available catalogsources are healthy",
    "reason": "AllCatalogSourcesHealthy",
    "status": "False",
    "type": "CatalogSourcesUnhealthy"
  }
]
```
The output above shows a false status for type CatalogSourcesUnHealthly, meaning the catalog sources are healthy.  WIP insert basic cluster health/resources check?
